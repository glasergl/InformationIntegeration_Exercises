		\item The algorithm needs exaclty as many steps as men are there.
		This is because, during the algorithm each man will propose to a woman who didn't have an offer before.
		Thus, she accepts and also, won't get further proposals which may could lead to a change (break up and new search for the man who lost the woman who he initially proposed to).
